Initialized with Create-React-App, and then added my own React/Redux to make this todo-list.

Followed a guide to create a todo-list app, and now am working on editing my soccer API to become a task API, and then will try to import those into this todo-list (soccer players weren't really relevant to the redux app - but I figured since todo lists were everywhere in redux guides that I would do one for times sake) 

now am working on finishing up the API (lost the file so i didn't upload it but it's on my computer somewhere..)
